        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Allocating just a square meter in your garden can be enough to grow your own food, 
            and maybe specialize in one type of food. Then you can register at <strong>The Online Garden Farmer's 
            Market</strong> with other people in your area that has done the same, and you can buy and sell to other
            garden-growers, as well as other people who donâ€™t grow, but wants to buy locally.
        </p>

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                The Online Garden Farmer`s Market was established in 2015 in Oslo by a few hobby gardners to support 
                a green environment and connect people in their community. Since then it has grown to other communities 
                connecting people with locally produced products and contributing to a greener climate.
